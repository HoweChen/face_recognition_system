# face_recognition_system
an applied face recognition system

## Usage
The **MTCNN detector** can only scan one person with a better result

A better result means that for one person, if you cover your mouth, the detector could still detect your face.

If you want the multiple person detection and recognition, please use **HOG version** instead
